# **CS50x Solutions: Comprehensive Week-by-Week Code Samples**

Welcome to my CS50x journey! This repository showcases my **detailed solutions** to the problem sets and labs from Harvard University's CS50x course. My solutions cover the material up to Week 8. Unfortunately, my CodeSpace encountered issues after that, and I apologize for any inconvenience this may cause.

## **Solution Validation**

All solutions in this repository have successfully passed the following validation tests:

- **style50:**
  - Each solution adheres to the CS50 **style guidelines**, as confirmed by the `style50` tool.

- **check50:**
  - Each solution has been rigorously tested against the provided test cases using the `check50` tool, ensuring correct functionality and compliance with the specified requirements.

Please note that passing these tests does not guarantee absolute correctness, and it is still essential to understand the underlying concepts and verify the solutions in different scenarios.

If you encounter any issues or have suggestions for improvement, feel free to open an issue or submit a pull request.

## **Week-wise Breakdown**

My approach involved completing both the **Lab** and **Problem Set (ProbSet)** for each week. I tackled both the **easy and hard problems** in the Problem Sets, aiming for a comprehensive understanding of the course material.

## **Usage Guidelines**

You are welcome to use these solutions as a reference or source of inspiration for your own work. Keep in mind that CS50x policies on **academic honesty** still apply. It's crucial to grasp the concepts behind the solutions and avoid submitting them as your own work if you are currently enrolled in the course.

To run any code, follow the instructions provided in the respective problem set specifications. Ensure that you have the necessary tools and dependencies installed.

## **Contributing Opportunities**

If you have improvements to suggest or find any issues with the solutions, feel free to open an issue or submit a pull request. Contributions are welcome!
